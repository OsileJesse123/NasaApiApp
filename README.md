# NasaApiApp
This project shows my implementation of Kotlin Flows while fetching data from the NASA APOD API

# Requirements
Network requests can be made using "DEMO_KEY" as an API key query but you are limited to 30 requests per hour per IP address and 50 requests per day per IP address.

You will need an API key to make network requests. You can get an API key from the link: https://api.nasa.gov.

After getting your API key, make sure to replace "DEMO_KEY" with your API key in the API_KEY property which is located in the AstronomyPictureRepositoryImpl class.
